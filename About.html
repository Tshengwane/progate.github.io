    <h2>Tshengwane Kaletsane</h2>
    <p>
        Tshengwane Kaletsane has had a deep interest in politics since a young age, and through 
        the use of ink as a medium, he is able to bring about awareness on the good and the bad of 
        events cause by political influence in a form of art. His work mainly focuses on the standard of politics and social 
        issues in the African continent. In his art, he portrays the relationship between leaders 
        and civilians of countries. His work is viewed as both negative and positive, which gives the 
        viewer an understanding of the two parties in play! 
        <hr>
        He also explores the events that happen in our daily lives. The negative and the positive!
